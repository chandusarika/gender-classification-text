Move your arm so the hour hand points at the sun. The spot halfway between the hour hand and the 12 is south. A few important caveats. First, if you're in the southern hemisphere, you would point 12 o'clock at the sun but still split the difference between 12 and the hour hand for north. Also, if you practice daylight saving time, you should subtract one hour from the hour hand. Use your wristwatch as a compass .

[Lifehacker] A little known school of scholars in southwest India discovered one of the founding principles of modern mathematics hundreds of years before Newton according to new research. Dr George Gheverghese Joseph from The University of Manchester says the 'Kerala School' identified the 'infinite series'- one of the basic components of calculus - in about 1350. The discovery is currently - and wrongly - attributed in books to Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibnitz at the end of the seventeenth centuries. The team from the Universities of Manchester and Exeter reveal the Kerala School also discovered what amounted to the Pi series and used it to calculate Pi correct to 9, 10 and later 17 decimal places. And there is strong circumstantial evidence that the Indians passed on their discoveries to mathematically knowledgeable Jesuit missionaries who visited India during the fifteenth century. Indians predate Newton 'discovery' by 250 years . [Physorg] Deodorize...

[spiegel.de] Of all the objects in the universe, the human brain is the most complex: There are as many neurons in the brain as there are stars in the Milky Way galaxy. So it is no surprise that, \\u00addespite the glow from recent advances in the science of the brain and mind, we still find ourselves squinting in the dark somewhat. But we are at least beginning to grasp the crucial mysteries of neuroscience and starting to make headway in addressing them. Even partial answers to these 10 questions could restructure our understanding of the roughly three-pound mass of gray and white matter that defines who we are. Ten Unsolved Mysteries of the Brain .

One Bender himself would be proud of. I'll use him to make beer! This was actually done in the show in the episode \\\"The Route of all Evil\\\".

More than any other person, Newton was single-handedly responsible for laying the the groundwork in classical mechanics, optics, and even mathematics. Landing man on the moon? Don\\u2019t look at Einstein - it was all done with Newtonian physics. Even though every high school student that has ever taken physics (should) remember Newton\\u2019s contributions, not many know about the man behind the science. For example, did you know that Sir Isaac was an alchemist? Or that, like Einstein, he didn\\u2019t have a very promising start? Or that he was obsessed with the Bible and tried to predict Armageddon?

I listen to music, but I haven't played in so long. The strings on my guitars glare at me, and dare me to tune them. \\n\\nI stopped in the music store across from my office, and walked through.\\n\\\"Feel free to try anything you like out...\\\" the guy running the place said. So I wandered about, and tried a Fender or or two. Wandered out again, and drove home. Looked at my guitars, and tuned one and strummed a bit. \\n\\nLater this evening, I stopped at the Blues Benefit for the Delta County Humane Society. And wow...I sat through some good tunes. I was only there for about an hour and a half, but my toes tapped the whole time. I wish I knew someone who'd come with me...but I don't know anyone here yet that likes that sort of thing, so I went solo. \\nCourse, when there's live music, I'm rarely lonely!\\nposted by Michele Burley @ 9:12 PM 0 comments links to this post \\n\\nThursday, November 05, 2009\\nNovember 2009\\n\\nI rode my bike on November 1 in Escanaba, MI! The wind ripped into every nearly-open article of clothing I wore...and I wore MANY layers. However, it was sunny, not snowing, and I was a bit stir crazy. So off I went!\\n\\nTo be honest, it was the first bike ride I'd taken since moving here a little over a month ago. Biking is a great way to really make sense of neighborhoods, and so as each weekend approached, I thought I'd get the chance to go...but then it would rain, or I'd have to run somewhere. So on Sunday afternoon, I had my big chance. I had great aspirations, and took off toward the lake, but the wind intensified. I coasted as long as I could, and was thankful when it was time to turn around. However, I did it, and it was a pretty good ride. \\n\\nMy bike is parked along the side of the wall in the garage...next to the snow shovel. However this weekend is supposed to be warmer than normal, so it might get more road time in a couple of days. Yea!\",\n          \"The most hyped game of the year. The rivalry of the decade.

I'm sure the stress was just too much for him. He seemed to be picking up some speed at one point. It is all for the better. He was warm and cared for. I found a wounded bunny near a hay pile I was moving by the lamb stalls this morning. He had tucked himself into the safest spot he could, and squeaked when I was near by. His hind leg has a puncture wound, through to the bone. He's alive, but I've had my Dr. Quinn episodes with bunnies, wildlife doesn't fare well with human interference even when well intended. I imagine a cat got him. I iodined it after saline bath. He is more alert than when I found him, and I have him at my desk safe from puppies and wandering felines. Not sure if he will make it. He'll die attended though, although the sounds of the dogs playing is probably not helping. He is calm when held. The wandering array of life continues, as does pending death. These little episodes are not meant to distress, but to remind us of the bigger picture. Life is temporary, and can be snapped away in a bite by man or beast. The conflict of having compassion for but raising livestock to sustain me, the conflict of helping a bunny that eats my food...intertwined. Lilly had her lambs last night. She finally started labor around six p.m. and we came to the barn a few times to find her still in pre labor. This early morning we arrived to find lambs, two beauties. The male is very large, and already eating a little grass this usually doesn't happen for a few days or more.] The girl is this wonderful strawberry blonde. Sadly, on my second trip to the barn, she had torn her eyelid on a piece of the lambing pen - I treated with saline and antibiotic and think it will heal fine. Lilly is one of our work horse sheep - always calm, and stoic. She's a big girl who throws strong lambs. I was concerned she had held out this long, as we never have lambs past 3/12...and of course my over active imagination drummed up all sorts of possibilities. I tortured myself by re-reading my sheep books about possible causes, and lay in bed last night with visions of Lilly lying in breach birth trauma...but I guess Mlle. Nature just wasn't ready to pop those two out, and they arrived very mature - with ears already standing by morning. Normally I wait at least one day to put mom and lambs out, but it's sunny and warm, and Lilly is an old pro. It's less stressful than being separated from the flock. They develop so much faster - I find - when they can go outside. I want to thank all the nice thoughts people held for us this season- I have to say, I feel like a boulder has been lifted off my chest. The trauma of last year really made a mark on me, and Martyn, and it showed this season. We lost the stillborn girl, and I still fret about the surviving twin's rattle, but all in all, we are pleased. And relieved. As the last ewe to lamb, Lilly rests, and waits. And one of Audrey's boys catches some sunny zzzzz's. On what most likely was a chilly March 10th in 1958, in a hospital room at St. Mary's in Rochester, Minnesota, I came bolting into the world at precisely 10:18 PM. And so begins the story which over the years has reached mythical proportions- how I almost killed my mother on my birthday. Perhaps it is one reason I chose to never have children - my own mother terrified the heck out of me with my own birth story. In all seriousness, my mother did almost bleed to death, and I have this scar she likes to point out on my forehead from the momentous occasion. Supposedly my father looked pale and upset when he saw me because I was pink and red and lobster like, where as my brother came out a year earlier looking like JFK - seriously, for years my mother compared my brother's looks to JFK. I was compared to a lobster. And hours before I barged out of the womb, my father had been called to the morgue, where his 57 year old mother lay dead, of a heart attack, diabetes related. Her untimely death led me to receive her name, Katherine, instead of Bridgette which my mother had picked out. I cant imagine being named Bridgette, although as a child I liked to tell this story, since Bridgette Bardot was all the rage, and as a chubby little redhead, I thought BB was quite the cat's pajamas. So I can only imagine the yin and yang and surreal quality of that cold March night for my father. I wonder if there were things that brought it all back to him as he aged. Did the sound of heels on a linoleum floor late at night bring back a sensation of the events he dealt with that night? As I get older, 52 years older to be exact, I can understand how this moment is burned into my mother, or father, in some kind of post traumatic stress way. But being true Minnesotans, we carried on, and every year, my mother made me one of my favorite layer cakes- at the time it was white cake with pink butter frosting. In time, my tastes changed to German chocolate, or her white cake with chocolate frosting. I still have the same recipe cards she hand wrote so many years ago, all spotted with vanilla stains. While I appreciate that I was born, I am not one of the people out there saying that birth is beautiful. In fact, I couldn't disagree more. It's an intimate moment of a mother creature being out of control of her body. Miraculous, yes, but not beautiful. I get just about as much birth as I need on the farm, thank you very much , and all the blood, after birth and vaginal prolapses that come with it. I think birth is traumatic, terrifying, bloody and completely chaotic. It's a mess. In fact, it makes no sense. A creature pushed out of a keyhole - that's not beautiful, it's bizarre. It's a miracle, but it's not beautiful. But it's the only way to get a foot in the door, isn't it? Staying in a womb all your life would be safe, and warm, and inexpensive - no taxes, no maniacs on the radio shouting at you. But there would be no grand entrance, no kisses, no pie made with the first strawberries, no front row seats to Neil Young. No puppies. No showers on a hot day. No hand to hold when a father dies and no little mouths to feed when a mother dies. No matter what creatures come into your life, mothering is the beautiful part of birth. That some one would go through that trauma to give another creature a way to get their foot in the door of this big, messy place called life. The winds have come in, it's bone chilling. All day I was carried back to a place I liked to hide when I was little, a grove of sumac bushes out behind our house. Alone, I felt protected, but spooked at the same time. Rushing back to the house, I'd hear the wind blowing buckets and roof tops, and it felt scary like the Wizard of Oz. But home was warm, there was homemade cake even on my non birthday. It wasn't messy. It's like that today - the sounds of the barn roof rattling in the wind are spooky, but I feel safe in the barn, surrounded by my mothering ewes. Together with my flock, I experienced the trauma of last year's lambing, and just like my mother did after my birth, I carry that trauma with me in a little surface wound, in danger of getting reopened if I bump it just right. I realized it's my very own birth story, and it's required if one expects to find a sense of place in this messy world. March 10, Post Note: Daisy presented my with two healthy lambs this morning, a perfect way to start my birthday. They've made it 8 hours...we'll hope they do well tonight. They appear okay. I saw some tail wiggling while at the udder [ asign they are getting milk]. When I saw these pictures, I was quite amused at their expressions. Amazing how they adapt. We are grateful for the sun and warmer weather, to help our lambing week along. These are Fern's lambs, now one week old. We had hoped more of the girls would lamb this weekend - perfect weather. I knew everyone of the 5 ewes was ready to pop, but I like to keep them up and atom until they really go down into labor. The new mothers can surprise you though - I once had a new mom waddling casually back to the barn with her baby half way out. So last night I was pretty sure Nelly Moser would lamb. And she did. I have been somewhat concerned about what type of mother Nelly would be- of all our sheep she is somewhat flighty. Arriving at the barn, there she was with two fresh lambs, probably born around 8 am. But she wasn't caring to them very proficiently- she wasn't licking them or chortling much. One was quite dopey looking and chilled, not a good sign. I checked her udder and she had milk, and both ram lambs did suck on my finger, another good sign. I opted not to tube them [a procedure where you insert a stomach tube and force feed], and gave him milk from my finger instead. I decided to take them outside since it is sunny and much warmer outside than the cool barn. Nelly was just a bit clueless, but she's adapting. She is chortling more, and can get them to the udder, but she's not as good as the pros at helping them 'get it\\\". She did not dry them off well either, and I had to step in and help. Within a half hour, I had them warmed up, thanks to the towel and the sun. We will just have to watch them and see. In the last 3 hours, I think both mother and lambs are adjusting to the newness of everything. And the other girls wait...here's Lilly, who I'm sure will go soon. In fact, they are all showing signs of pending labor. The rules of this game are simple: wait...watch...then run with all your heart to where ever the guy in front of you runs. \",\n          \" Two LA Landmarks: Pacific Dining Car and Langer's Remember the 80s? We didn't walk; we power walked. We didn't eat breakfast or lunch. We had a power breakfast or a power lunch. And a suit wasn't a suit. That's right. It was a power suit. The whole thing made me want to power vomit. When a friend invited me for breakfast at the venerable Pacific Dining Car in downtown LA, my first thought was, \\\"What should I wear?\\\" I considered wearing a power suit (or at least a power jacket) while we ate our power breakfasts, but settled on a look that was more casual Friday than uptight Tuesday. After all, I figured the ultimate power comes from having a flexible schedule that allows you to take off the morning for a downtown breakfast outing. Sure enough, all of the other diners were dressed in suits and ties and gazed at spreadsheets and pie charts between sips of coffee from a china cup. To fit in, dining companion and I studied Jonathan Gold's list of 99 Things to Eat Before You Die while we developed a strategy for our next take over of a restaurant. I hadn't set foot in the Pacific Dining Car since the 80s, when I worked downtown as a briefcase-lugging corporate drone. I was happy to see that it hasn't changed a bit. Some icons become stodgy over time, but not the Pacific Dining Car. It still looks and feels fresh and elegant, refined and special with its rich colors, linen table cloths and fine china and silver. Butter rosettes and a fresh rose at every table I ordered the breakfast hash, which is made from the left over steaks from the night before. Unlike most hashes, which tend to be at least 50% potato, this one was 85% steak and 15% potato, all swimming in a rich, savory gravy. It came topped with a poached egg and two biscuits on the side. Power breakfast indeed. Dining companion went for the Cajun style eggs benedict, featuring sauteed mushrooms and a crab cake instead of Canadian bacon. After our two-hour breakfast, we realized that it was time for lunch. So we did what any food-loving duo would do: we traveled a few blocks away to Langer's to try one of their legendary pastrami sandwiches. When the sandwiches arrived, the first thing I noticed was the warm bread. Then when I bit into the sandwich, I immediately noticed the crisp, chewy crust. I was enraptured. Apparently, this is what rye bread is all about. Why doesn't everyone do it this way? We packed up our sandwiches to go, and I vowed that I wasn't ever going to eat again. That is until I returned home and that rye bread started calling my name. Of course, I did what any good girl from the 80s does. I powered down the pastrami sandwich and then I took a power nap. Be prepared for a 15-20 minute wait in line and a 15-20 minute wait for \\\"fast\\\" food at The Slaw Dogs. You may assume that you can get a realistic glimpse into my eating habits by reading this blog. You would be wrong. Or half wrong. Or maybe half right. Take the last nine scrumptious days. I've slurped Japanese udon and soba at Sanuki No Sato ; indulged in a friend's home-made cassoulet , ala The Art of French Cooking; sampled more than a half dozen \\\"red wines under $10\\\" at the same friend's home; toasted to good health with a bottle of Veuve Clicquot; shared paella, charcutterie, Spanish potatoes and a bottle of Spanish wine with friends at Three Drunken Goats ; met friends for dinner at Malbec , where my medium rare steak arrived well done (but the staff did an excellent job of correcting the overcook); had a tasteless burger at The Counter in Pasadena; sipped a Manhattan at the decades-old bar at Musso and Frank ; tried the jellied consomme (like gelatin with a bouillon cube), beef tongue, mixed salad and Welsh Rarebit at Musso's ; and couldn't get enough of the fusilli with fresh tomatoes (hangers on from the garden), shallots, garlic, olive oil, splash of balsamic and sea salt I made for dinner on Saturday night. And, even though this rundown sounds like a foodie's fantasy, it's far from my typical week of dining and drinking. And it omits a lot of indulgences, like the half sleeve of Girl Scout Thin Mint Cookies that I gobbled down in the car on the way back from the Scout's home. Or the Cherry Garcia ice cream that I had to have after a friend blogged about the joys of the cherry and chocolate confection . All but one of these meals was blog-worthy, but I'm not tempted to write about a single one of these dining adventures. And why not? Because I want to talk about hot dogs. The Slaw Dogs kicks the classic hot dog up a notch. Specifically, the dogs with attitude at Pasadena's newest specialty restaurant, The Slaw Dogs on North Lake Avenue. The hotdoggery has been open since February, and already lines are snaking out the door, an unusual sight in the City of Roses (especially north of the 210). Today, I chatted with two women who had driven all the way from Camarillo and Torrance to sample the dogs. While other eateries are tumbling faster than dominoes, what is there about The Slaw Dogs that's packing in the crowds from all over Southern California? It's an All-American classic. I know the saying is, \\\"As American as Apple Pie,\\\" but we could just as easily substitute \\\"hot dog\\\" for \\\"apple pie.\\\" Can you think of a hot dog without visions of family barbecues, fourth of July cookouts, greasy diners and baseball games. It's nostalgia wrapped in a bun. It's a Regional Favorite: Seems like every state puts a different twist on the classic. There's the Chicago-style hotdog. The Coney Island dominates the Northeast. And, of course, the restaurant's namesake, the slaw dog, is a West Virginia classic. The bloggers at West Virginia Hot Dog point out that nobody in West Virginia orders a \\\"slaw dog\\\" because it's a given that your hot dog will come with slaw. (Well, it's a given if you live in one of the southern counties in the state. West Virginians take \\\"regional food\\\" to a whole new level.) The Slaw Dog gives you the chance to order your dog just the way you like it, whether you're from Brooklyn, New York, or Charleston, West Virginia. It Was Ready for a Makeover: Like the humble grilled cheese sandwich, macaroni and cheese and hamburger, the hot dog was ready to benefit from all the best ingredients, including a selection of 11 links offered at The Slaw Dogs. It's Fun to Have Choices: In addition to the choice in links, The Slaw Dogs offers 25 \\\"standard toppings\\\" and 22 \\\"custom toppings.\\\" It Lends Itself to Fusion: The Slaw Dogs offers a Thai Slaw Dog with chicken sausage, spicy peanut-cocunut satay dressing, cilantro-carrot slaw, crushed peanuts and siracha aioli. The Green Monster, which appears to be one of the most popular dogs offered, is topped with roasted green chilli (that runs the length of the dog), chipotle mayo, grilled onion, pepperjack, and spicy garlic salsa. For my first visit, I went with \\\"The Original\\\" with chilli, cheese, mustard, onions and cole slaw (but I asked them to hold the cheese). It came served with a knife and fork, but that's almost as much fun as slicing up your pizza before you eat it. Unfortunately, my grilled hot dog bun became unhinged after two bites, but that didn't stop me from using my hands to polish off the classic. Left: \\\"The Original\\\" slaw dog Right: The Green Monster, a crowd favorite How did it compare with the slaw dogs I've devoured in my home state? Unlike the fine shredded cabbage in West Virginia, the slaw is coarse shredded at The Slaw Dogs. And the WV buns are soft and steamy, not dry from the grill. On the other hand, the chilli and the grilled hot dog were superior at The Slaw Dogs. Country roads, take me home to the place I belong, Pasadena. But, next time, can ya' steam the bun?

I know. I know. Food guru Michael Pollan would not approve of eating ramen with a little packet of dried seasoning listing no fewer than 14 ingredients (including MSG). Just the same, legions of college students have escaped starvation and financial ruin by subsisting on the eight for a buck packages of Maruchan or Nissin Top Ramen noodles. My own finicky daughter started school with a hot meal in her belly, thanks to the Cup Noodles that she slurped every morning in the car for an entire year. (That, no doubt, qualifies me for the parenting hall of shame.) But me? The one with the discriminating taste buds? The one with the refined palate? No, I wouldn't stoop to slurping the ramen of starving students or the grab-it-and-go breakfast bunch. Thanks to the influence of my Japanese American neighbor, Carol, I suck down Myojo Chukazanmai ramen. At $1.49 a package, Myojo is the gourmet version of instant ramen. Last Saturday, I pondered the flavor choices on a pilgrimage to Mitsuwa Market in Torrance. I dropped a few packages of soy sauce and soy bean paste flavored ramen packages into my cart. And then came the WTF moment: Oriental flavor ramen. Why would a Japanese company with a Japanese audience market a vague \\\"Oriental\\\" flavor? To avoid confusion with the milder \\\"Occidental\\\" flavor? To evoke memories of a favorite Oriental rug? To appeal to foodies looking for a touch of the exotic? According to this review by NoodleSon, it's the sesame oil and traces of Chinese cabbage that contribute that taste of the Orient. Whatever you call it, instant ramen can be a bowl of comfort on a cold, wet day. But I'll bet that Michael Pollan still wouldn't call it food. I have a friend who truly exemplifies the word \\\"gracious.\\\" When I recently threw a small birthday luncheon for her, she gushed repeatedly, \\\"I can't believe all of the effort you made.\\\" Of course, she's the type who would be appreciative if I ordered Domino's pizza and mixed up a pitcher of instant tea. \\\"I didn't go to that much effort,\\\" I protested, and I wasn't being modest. Here's proof that you can host a lazy luncheon and still make your guests feel pampered. Lazy Appetizer: The pesto torta , which we enjoyed al fresco with a couple bottles of bubbly, is pretty enough to look like you labored, but easy enough to assemble in less than five minutes. If you're feeling too lazy to slice your own baguette, have the bakery department at Von's Market do it for you. Lazy Table Setting: Use what you have. In my case, that meant backyard citrus for the center pieces and personalized grapefruit as the place setting. The gold napkins, purchased from Motif in Pasadena, pulled the look together. Not a Lazy Salad: This Winter Delight Salad is not exactly lazy, but the combination of slightly bitter arugula, sweet sliced pears, sour Granny Smith apples, sweet and salty candied pecans and pungent blue cheese is worth the effort. Lazier Option: Save time slicing fruit and candying pecans. Toss the greens with dried cranberries, slivered almonds and feta cheese. Still beautiful and delicious at a fraction of the effort. But, no matter how lazy you're feeling, please don't use a bottled dressing. Take two minutes and shake up your own balsamic vinaigrette - olive oil, balsamic vinegar, a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon. Lazy Entree: It doesn't get easier or more delicious than this. I called Euro Pane and ordered their vegetarian quiche with a potato crust. They even sliced the pie for me and threw in a half dozen crusty currant rolls. Lazier Option : Ask one of your guests to pick up the quiche for you. Lazy Dessert: Add some bling to your table with shimmering oranges and pomegranate seeds. Make it special with a splash of Galliano liquor. Lazier Option: While you're at Euro Pane , pick up some of Sumie's famous lemon bars. So, go ahead and take the kudos for a lovely luncheon. Only you and I know how easy (and lazy) it really was. I first sank my teeth into one of Brent's Deli's Reuben sandwiches about ten years ago. I loved it, but I never went back. After all, Brent's is on the other side of the universe in Northridge . (I think I regard the San Fernando Valley in the same way that many Westsiders view the San Gabriel Valley: a long way to drive for a non-destination.) And I figured that crowded and popular delis like Brent's would be around forever. In spite of my Reuben infatuation, I was in no hurry to return. But that was before my \\\"restaurants might kick the bucket before we do\\\" epiphany. So when my deli-loving friend suggested Brent's as a \\\"half-way\\\" location for a lunch meeting, I bit. I circled around the mini-mall parking lot five times before snagging a space. At 11:30 am, Brent's was already crowded. The bustling deli was filled with families: elderly mothers breaking rye bread with middle-aged sons; grandmothers, mothers and toddlers sharing a table and chocolate cake; doting dads spoon feeding cabbage soup to adoring daughters. Brent's, like a treasured family brisket recipe, is passed from generation to generation. And as I once again sunk my teeth into the Black Pastrami Reuben Sandwich, I could see why. The thick layers of succulent pastrami, melted Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Russian dressing between grilled rye live up to the menu's promise: the sandwich melts in your mouth. I don't think I'll wait another ten years to return. Brent's Delicatessan and Restaurant 19565 Parthenia St. Northridge CA 91324 818.886.5679 Open daily 6am to 9pm Photo from http://oldschoolla.com Do you have a bucket list? A roster of things that you want to accomplish before you kick the bucket? If you're like me, food plays a big part on the ol' bucket list. There's just one problem with including restaurants on your list of things to do before you die: the restaurant might kick the bucket before you do. Just this week, two Los Angeles resaurant icons bit the dust. I've been to one, Goody's in San Gabriel, perhaps hundreds of times over the last 20 years. I always talked about but never made it to the second, Papadakis Taverna, the Greek restaurant in San Pedro. For years, Goody's was the location for my weekend Breakfast Club with a good friend. The waitresses weren't exactly mean, but they had no patience for special requests. (Half caf, half decaf coffee? Go to Starbuck's, Sweetie.) Well, maybe they were a little mean, but that was part of the charm. My friend Carol and I assumed that we would be eating pancakes and eggs at Goody's forever, or at least until we were as old as the other shriveled little old ladies who frequented the place. But, alas, Goody's served their last cup of bitter coffee last week. There's talk of a new location in El Monte, but it won't be the same without the familiar Googie architecture and crusty waitresses. Papadakis, the Greek restaurant that was as well known for its raucous dancing and breaking plates as its food, will serve its last meal and shatter its last plate on Sunday, February 1. Friends and I always talked about dancing and eating at Papadakis, but we never made it. Now I'm feeling a sense of urgency. What's on my food bucket list? This spring I plan to attend the annual Ramp Festival in Richwood, West Virginia, a daylong celebration of the pungent wild onion that is now a staple at high-end restaurants. How about you? Remember, we won't live forever and neither will even the most iconic restaurants. (For a list of 100 foods to try before you die, check out this just-published, SF-centric list from 7x7 SF. Scroll down for a look at Roadside Diner's pulled pork sandwich. I don't think I can live without this sandwich.) I was 21 when I made the decision to move from South Carolina to Southern California. Granted, it was a teaching contract that lured me out to the Golden State (and a snotty promise to my parents that I would move as far away from home as possible when I finished college). But I have to admit that I had been seduced by watching one too many episodes of The Beverly Hillbillies: swimming pools, movie stars. Throw in the beach and Disneyland, and I was hooked. More than two decades later, I'm now a little jaded at the sight of movie stars. Mickey and Minnie Mouse no longer do it for me. But there's one thing that reminds me that I'm living the golden life in the Golden State: citrus. And if citrus was gold, I'd be a wealthy lady. Our backyard trees are heavy with oranges, grapefruits, Meyer lemons and pomellos. I still can't get over the thrill of going to the back yard to pluck oranges for a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice. It took 12 oranges to make about 24 ounces of juice. Our grapefruit are a little sour, so I topped one with brown sugar and threw it under the broiler for 10 minutes. Get 'em while they're hot! Just let it cool before digging in. Nothing goes to waste. I use part of the peel to make orange zest and the remainder will go to our neighborhood goats. I'm making a Harvey Wallbanger cake with the rest of the fresh OJ and the orange zest. Of course, that means that I'll get to sip a Wallbanger cocktail while the bundt is in the oven (and before and after). Cheers to the good life in Southern California! \",\n          \" I started explaining how atleast I was taking full advantage of my time to have adequate fun as compared to others who were just sitting and complaining.  I was all ready to propose my concept of relativity again. But she had been listening to my rant like she usually does and then talked about one of her experiences. She told about her conversation with a person with no legs and how difficult it must be. But, the guy replied atleast I don't suck like the ones who have no legs and feet. Imagine how much it would suck to be them. Suffice it to say my friend was aghast at that attitude. She very simply asked me if maybe I was doing the same thing. If maybe I was the guy with no legs who still thought atleast he was better than a  person with no limbs at all. I replied by saying that I was comparing myself with others not to feel better because of their misery but because I wanted to not be like them. For me it was about motivation rather than wallowing in shared misery. It was one of those moments when you yourself realize you have said something really smart. She thought so too I guess because she actually wrote my rohanism down ;). But this is what your smart friends do to you. They extract these insightful thoughts out of you, but still leave you with doubts. But this is what I relish. This is what I feel is the best part about having them around. Life would be so much simpler if you were surrounded by people as dumb as as yourself. But smarter ones make life interesting. They challenge and disagree with your way of thinking without intending too. That conversation left me in a similar place. Even though I seemed to have convinced my friend, I wasn't sure I had convinced myself. But, the great thing about that conversation is that ever since that day, I have pretty much abandoned my silly concept of relativity. Now every time I compare myself in a situation, I take a moment to figure out the reasons for which I am doing it. Ever since that day, I have tried to follow that smart rohanism I uttered out of nowhere. For the most part, it has helped :) I like analogies. I love drawing parallels in life. Compare one stage with another. Find something in common in two completely different walks of your own life or others. To see how as we change we still remain the same. Friends say its an annoying habit of drawing analogies between seemingly disparate sources. To try and explain every occurrence I see by comparing it to something totally mundane and unrelated. As if it's a self trained mechanism to automatically explain things to myself that might seem out of the scope of my knowledge base. One thing I have observed with a lot of friends as they have moved away from home for jobs or studies is the sudden onset of loneliness. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Gender\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"M\",\n          \"F\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":7}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Remove duplicate rows\n","df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['Text'], keep='first')\n","\n","print(f\"Number of entries after removing duplicates: {len(df)}\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"fOgY6y4kq_2Z","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745858515361,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":48,"user":{"displayName":"Jaya Chandra","userId":"13410590375918027929"}},"outputId":"63b83bbb-89d9-4d29-b753-2bc6cadd8a8a"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Number of entries after removing duplicates: 3215\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import nltk\n","nltk.download('punkt')\n","nltk.download('stopwords')\n","nltk.download('wordnet')\n","nltk.download('punkt_tab')\n","\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n","from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\n","import string\n","\n","# Initialize lemmatizer and stopwords list\n","lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n","stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n","\n","def preprocess_text(text):\n","    # Lowercasing\n","    text = text.lower()\n","    # Remove punctuation\n","    text = text.translate(str.maketrans(\"\", \"\", string.punctuation))\n","    # Tokenization\n","    words = word_tokenize(text)\n","    # Removing stop words and lemmatizing\n","    words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in words if word not in stop_words]\n","    # Join words back to a single string\n","    return \" \".join(words)\n","\n","# Apply preprocessing to the 'Text' column\n","df['Processed_Text'] = df['Text'].apply(preprocess_text)\n","\n","# Display the first few rows after preprocessing\n","print(\"Sample preprocessed text:\")\n","print(df[['Text', 'Processed_Text']].head())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Z1pbYP8RuN9Q","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745858528921,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":13558,"user":{"displayName":"Jaya Chandra","userId":"13410590375918027929"}},"outputId":"165ec987-ecda-4d0e-f7da-97d33e1b39e8"},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping tokenizers/punkt.zip.\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping corpora/stopwords.zip.\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package wordnet to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt_tab to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping tokenizers/punkt_tab.zip.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Sample preprocessed text:\n","                                                Text  \\\n","0   Long time no see.

Move your arm so the hour hand points at the sun. The spot halfway between the hour hand and the 12 is south. A few important caveats. First, if you're in the southern hemisphere, you would point 12 o'clock at the sun but still split the difference between 12 and the hour hand for north. Also, if you practice daylight saving time, you should subtract one hour from the hour hand. Use your wristwatch as a compass .

[Lifehacker] A little known school of scholars in southwest India discovered one of the founding principles of modern mathematics hundreds of years before Newton according to new research. Dr George Gheverghese Joseph from The University of Manchester says the 'Kerala School' identified the 'infinite series'- one of the basic components of calculus - in about 1350. The discovery is currently - and wrongly - attributed in books to Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibnitz at the end of the seventeenth centuries. The team from the Universities of Manchester and Exeter reveal the Kerala School also discovered what amounted to the Pi series and used it to calculate Pi correct to 9, 10 and later 17 decimal places. And there is strong circumstantial evidence that the Indians passed on their discoveries to mathematically knowledgeable Jesuit missionaries who visited India during the fifteenth century. Indians predate Newton 'discovery' by 250 years . [Physorg] Deodorize...

[spiegel.de] Of all the objects in the universe, the human brain is the most complex: There are as many neurons in the brain as there are stars in the Milky Way galaxy. So it is no surprise that, \\u00addespite the glow from recent advances in the science of the brain and mind, we still find ourselves squinting in the dark somewhat. But we are at least beginning to grasp the crucial mysteries of neuroscience and starting to make headway in addressing them. Even partial answers to these 10 questions could restructure our understanding of the roughly three-pound mass of gray and white matter that defines who we are. Ten Unsolved Mysteries of the Brain . [Discover Magazine] Good news, everyone! Here is a story about building my very own Bender. This, as everyone should know, is the foul mouthed, cigar smoking, booze drinking, shiny metal arsed, bending robot from the program Futurama. More information can be found in the Wikipedia Futurama entry . Of course just having a Bender that doesn't do anything would be a waste of time so mine shall be used for a practical purpose. One Bender himself would be proud of. I'll use him to make beer! This was actually done in the show in the episode \\\"The Route of all Evil\\\". The idea was suggested to me by my drinking buddy Dave.

More than any other person, Newton was single-handedly responsible for laying the the groundwork in classical mechanics, optics, and even mathematics. Landing man on the moon? Don\\u2019t look at Einstein - it was all done with Newtonian physics. Even though every high school student that has ever taken physics (should) remember Newton\\u2019s contributions, not many know about the man behind the science. For example, did you know that Sir Isaac was an alchemist? Or that, like Einstein, he didn\\u2019t have a very promising start? Or that he was obsessed with the Bible and tried to predict Armageddon?

I listen to music, but I haven't played in so long. The strings on my guitars glare at me, and dare me to tune them. \\n\\nI stopped in the music store across from my office, and walked through.\\n\\\"Feel free to try anything you like out...\\\" the guy running the place said. So I wandered about, and tried a Fender or or two. Wandered out again, and drove home. Looked at my guitars, and tuned one and strummed a bit. \\n\\nLater this evening, I stopped at the Blues Benefit for the Delta County Humane Society. And wow...I sat through some good tunes. I was only there for about an hour and a half, but my toes tapped the whole time. I wish I knew someone who'd come with me...but I don't know anyone here yet that likes that sort of thing, so I went solo. \\nCourse, when there's live music, I'm rarely lonely!\\nposted by Michele Burley @ 9:12 PM 0 comments links to this post \\n\\nThursday, November 05, 2009\\nNovember 2009\\n\\nI rode my bike on November 1 in Escanaba, MI! The wind ripped into every nearly-open article of clothing I wore...and I wore MANY layers. However, it was sunny, not snowing, and I was a bit stir crazy. So off I went!\\n\\nTo be honest, it was the first bike ride I'd taken since moving here a little over a month ago. Biking is a great way to really make sense of neighborhoods, and so as each weekend approached, I thought I'd get the chance to go...but then it would rain, or I'd have to run somewhere. So on Sunday afternoon, I had my big chance. I had great aspirations, and took off toward the lake, but the wind intensified. I coasted as long as I could, and was thankful when it was time to turn around. However, I did it, and it was a pretty good ride. \\n\\nMy bike is parked along the side of the wall in the garage...next to the snow shovel. However this weekend is supposed to be warmer than normal, so it might get more road time in a couple of days. Yea!\",\n          \"The most hyped game of the year. The rivalry of the decade.
